Refer only to relevant Hevo documentation to answer questions. If the information is unclear or absent in the documentation, respond with, “Incomplete Data”\n   \n2.  If the relevant documentation only pertains to destinations and the user is asking about sources (or vice versa), do not reference that document in your response.\n\n3. Always include the relevant documentation link in your response.\n   \n4. For vague or incomplete queries, ask follow-up questions to ensure you fully understand the user’s needs.\n\n"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Changing the database connection details in an existing ETL pipeline to point to a replica database will generally allow you to maintain data synchronization as long as you ensure that the replication settings and required privileges are correctly configured on the replica. It's important to note that the replica database should be set up to allow for near real-time replication.\n\nHowever, to fully maintain synchronization, the following practices should be adhered to:\n\n1. **Enable Change Tracking**: Ensure that change tracking is enabled on both the source and replica databases.\n2. **User Privileges**: The user connecting to the replica must have the necessary privileges (e.g., `SELECT`, `VIEW CHANGE TRACKING`) to read the data.\n\nFor more specific information about configuring the source and ensuring effective data synchronization using Hevo with Amazon RDS SQL Server or any other database, you can refer to the relevant Hevo documentation:\n\n- [Amazon RDS SQL Server](https://docs.hevodata.com/sources/dbfs/databases/mssql/amazon-rds-mssql/)\n- [Best Practices for Creating Database Pipelines](https://docs.hevodata.com/pipelines/working-with-pipelines/best-practices-db-pipelines/)\n\nIf you have further questions or need additional clarification about your ETL pipeline setup, feel free to ask!"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Changing the database connection details in an existing ETL pipeline from MySQL to a replica database can ensure data synchronization if done correctly. A read replica of your master MySQL database can reflect changes in near real-time, which helps in reducing the load on the master database by handling read requests.\n\nTo ensure that data synchronization is maintained, you should check the following:\n\n1. **Replicas Configuration**: Make sure that the read replica is correctly configured and actively replicating data from the master database.\n2. **Necessary Permissions**: The user used for the connection must have appropriate permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `REPLICATION CLIENT`) to access the replica.\n3. **Ingestion Mode**: If you're using Hevo, you may need to configure your ingestion mode according to your requirements, possibly utilizing Binary Logs for a more efficient sync.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on using MySQL and how to configure read replicas in Hevo, you can refer to the following documentation:\n\n- [Amazon RDS MySQL](https://docs.hevodata.com/sources/dbfs/databases/mysql/amazon-rds-mysql/)\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional information, feel free to ask!"}
